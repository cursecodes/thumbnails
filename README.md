# `üèûÔ∏è thumbnails `

Thumbnails is a basic Cloudflare Workers setup to act as the old `api.roblox.com` thumbnail API that only needed one request to get the image.

More routes will be added soon, but today you can start using it at `https://your.deployment.workers.dev/headshot/USER_ID/SIZE`, where `USER_ID` is the User ID and `SIZE` is one of the acceptable sizes for headshots (48x48, 50x50, 60x60, 75x75, 100x100, 110x110, 150x150, 180x180, 352x352, 420x420, 720x720) formatted to just to one of the axis, e.g. 150x150 becomes just 150 and 352x352 becomes 352. API Docs will be added soon.

## Install
You will need Node.js and Git installed, as well as a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com).

Here is a nice stacked command that should get you to the login step with Cloudflare:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cursecodes/thumbnails.git
cd thumbnails
npm i -g wrangler
npm install
wrangler login
```
Once you have logged in, run:
```bash
wrangler dev
```

And to publish on the internet:
```bash
wrangler publish ./src/index.ts
```
`wrangler publish` will give you a published URL that you can share, and you can log into the Cloudflare dashboard to get usage statistics.
